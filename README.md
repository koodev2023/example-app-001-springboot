## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine and Docker Compose) installed.
*   Git (for cloning the repository).

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Run using Docker Compose (Recommended):**
    The application (frontend, backend, and MongoDB) can be started using Docker Compose.
    *(You might need to provide a `docker-compose.yml` file or adjust this section based on your setup)*
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    This will build the images if they don't exist and start the containers in detached mode.

3.  **Access the application:**
    *   Frontend (React): `http://localhost:3000` (or `http://localhost:5173` if Vite's default)
    *   Backend (Spring Boot): `http://localhost:8080`

    *(Adjust ports if they are different in your configuration.)*

## üß™ Testing

The backend includes unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and functionality. Code coverage is measured using JaCoCo.

To run backend tests (typically done within an IDE or using Maven/Gradle commands):
```bash
# If using Maven
mvn test

# If using Gradle
./gradlew test
